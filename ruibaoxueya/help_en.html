    	<p>The bluetooth of Standard WBP monitor and my phone have been paired, and when I access into Standard APP “More”—“Bluetooth Setting”, it proved the blue tooth have been paired, but why I still cannot use the phone to manage the monitor for BP measurement?</p>
        <p>Reason: The Bluetooth between your phone and WBP monitor have not been connected successfully because of the signal interruption around or the previous connection of Standard APP have not been closed yet. </p>
        <p>Solution: Power off the phone and Standard BP monitor, and then reopen them, try the connection. </p>
    </li>

    	<p>Standard WBP monitor doesn’t give any reaction, it seems crashed. How to handle this?</p>
        <p>Answer: Connect the WBP monitor to power using the USB cable, then push the button. The WBP monitor should wake up and work normally.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    	<p>The WBP monitor stopped BP measurement by itself while I connect the monitor to power for battery charging. Why?</p>
        <p>Answer: For safe, the WBP monitor would not give any measurement while battery charging. It would be back to work normally after charging. </p>
    </li>

    	<p>I wear the WBP on right arm and find that the cuff get folded and the monitor locate at the arm inner side. It’s pretty inconvenient. Why? </p>
        <p>Answer: Because left arm is the best place to measure BP as it’s close to the heart. So the WBP cuff is designed for left arm. It’s ok to try a measurement on right arm, but the user should try to use left arm most of the time. </p>
    </li>

    	<p>After programming, I left the monitor aside and forgot it. Later the monitor shutting off by itself. Why? </p>
        <p>Answer: After programming, the monitor will give BP measurement automatically. For power saving, the monitor will go to sleep mode by itself after 3 times no BP-signal measurement. If the user later re-wear the monitor and want to start the automatic measurement again (within 24 hours), what he/she need to do is just simply push the “Start/Stop”button. The monitor will then resume the programming measurement.</p>
    </li>
	<li>
    	<p>Sometimes while doing BP measurement, the monitor will inflate the 2nd time, why?</p>
        <p>Answer: Standard WBP monitor usually inflate automatically to the pressure of last systolic reading plus 38mmHg. It can help to improve the user comfort. But while during inflation, if the monitor find the inflation level is not enough for a sudden high reading, it will inflate the 2nd time for success measurement. </p>

    	<p>How to clean the cuff?</p>
        <p>You can wash the cuff. Hold the cuff with your hand and hold the WBP monitor with another hand. Force the cuff and monitor to separate slowly starting from the button side. After separation, take the bladder and bracket out from the opening at the cuff edge. Then you can wash the cuff. After that, put the bladder and bracket back to cuff, and get the five hooks on the bracket out from the five cuts on the cuff. Finally insert the five hooks of the bracket to the back of the monitor. Then the cuff is assembled back to monitor. </p>
